# testingkivy.
This is about testing and learning about kivy through trial and error and also using other pyhton libraries to create some interesting outputs.
This particular example contain an app which can take any text file containing numbers.
It then creates a 2D graph using matplotlib librabry.
It uses tkinter's askopenfilename() for path (kivy's file chooser can also be used).
The graph is the saved in the current directory (does not display graph).
Two choices of line and scatter plot are given.
